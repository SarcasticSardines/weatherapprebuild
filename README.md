# Weather App

+ Rebuild a previous weather app in NextJS that inlcudes:
    -ability to save favrites to local storage
    -display weather information for the current time and location
    -display forecast data for the upcoming week
    -ability to search other locations and display their current weather information as well

+ Review: The weather app leaves a lot to be desired. White the app seems to populate data from the user's current location, the user is unable to search for a city to look at its weather. The favorite button is broken, and the website lack substantial stylization. Hopefully you can do better next week, mate.
